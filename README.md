# Income Prediction Project

This project aims to predict income levels based on demographic and employment-related features using machine learning algorithms. We explore various models, evaluate their performance, and provide insights into the factors contributing to higher income levels. 

### Key Objectives:
- Predict income levels based on features such as age, education, occupation, and more.
- Evaluate the performance of different machine learning models.
- Provide actionable insights into factors influencing higher income levels.

### Significance:
This project can assist non-profit organizations in evaluating donation requests from individuals based on their income predictions.

### Technologies Used:
- Machine Learning algorithms
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model evaluation metrics
